# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?

This project asked us to make a banking app where we could see our investment if we potential invested with an annual amount of interest. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I created the user display really well. It takes the user from one screen to another really well and completely. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code efficient, secure, and so on?

The main part of the code I dont think I can enhace because it was what was asked of us. If we were asked to show an different aspect of investment then that is something I could use to enhance the code. But for now according to what I created what I actually could enhance was the user display. If I made the user input appear in a different color then that would differentiate what the input is and whats asked by the program. This would make the readability of our program much better. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write. and how did you over come this? What tools are you adding to youre support network?

The most difficult part of the code to write was the math in the for loop that would continue iterate for a couple of lines. 

What skills from this project will be particulary transferable to other projects or course work?

Defintely my organizational skills will come in handy in future projects and in life. This type of program also seems like a very good real world scenario that one might have to come up with in a job like that. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This program is maintable and readable because when creating it, i put notes in all the important lines of code.
